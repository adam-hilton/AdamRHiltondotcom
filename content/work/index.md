[![Chimera WLD Event](squarepromoart.jpg "World Listening Day 2024")](https://worldlisteningday.org/events/chimera-world-listening-day-2024/)



#### July 18, 2024
### Pease Park, Austin, TX

In celebration of World Listening Day, July 18th, 2024 at 7pm, Collide Arts and Phonography Austin presented a sound installation, CHIMERA, in which field recordings were be played continuously throughout lower Pease Park. Artists were encouraged to submit field recordings that were made outside of the context of Pease Park – other biomes than Pease Park, from other seasons than summer, in other contexts than an urban park, in order to find out what happens when one soundscape is grafted onto another

Other contributing artists are Ann Armstrong, Henna Chou, Ara Herandez, Alex Keller, Steven N. Landry, Christopher McConnell, H. Montgomery, Alex Keller, and Josh Ronsen.

2-3 sentence paragraph or 2
In "Hindsight", Adam Hilton, Henna Chou and Laura Brackney sonically confronted the accumulation of memory as we age, and how our natural tendencies to look to our past for meaning only become more of a barrier to the present the older we get.

Tierras Sonidas Sonic Rodeo is a sound art festival that blossomed from desert visions during the opening performance of 'Not Flowers', a solo visual exhibition by Mo Eldridge at Do Right Hall in 2023. The event witnessed a convergence of sonic energy from Super Ethereal Champion World, Anthony Desimone, Veronica Anne Salinas, Liv Mershon, Eric Capper, and Mo Eldridge, each performing around a communal table to a packed audience. 

That energy was carried forward in this year’s Sonic Rodeo, bringing together emerging and established performers and artists from Texas, the Midwest, Oklahoma, and California. Set in the Marfa community, Tierras Sonidas celebrated sound art and experimental sounds inspired by the West Texas landscape.

## Forest Meditation

In association with Elizabeth Chapin’s Treespell
Date: February 9, 2024
Location: Women and Their Work Gallery

2-3 sentence paragraph or 2
Hilton and Chou respond to Elizabeth Chapin’s Treespell exhibit, using electronic and acoustic sounds to engage the audience in a meditative environment.

About Treepsell: A commentary on today’s crowded visual culture and the growing sense of separation between humans and nature, Chapin’s work reflects and rejects the ways in which the modern world has turned away from nature and toward a constant influx of digital visual information. Treespell is an overarching story about this mutual spell that we’re all involved in; we become ‘beasted’ when we become separate from nature. Chapin’s colorful paintings of trees, which she approaches with the specific and thoughtful care usually reserved for portraiture, remind us of the value of returning our time, attention, and gaze back toward the natural world.

Gentle our Driftless Caravan
September 1-2 & 8-12, 2022

“The score and choreography combine to suggest big emotions— separation, grief, love— and the farm setting roots the piece in a deep sense of place. It is spectacular and meditative, intimate and grand— triumphantly full of contradictions that work.”
- Courtney Thomas, SIGHTLINES Magazine

### Linen Closet, band leader

Linen Closet was an indie-folk band that leaned heavily into orchestral and electronic elements. Performances would just as often include quiet, poignant songs with 10-piece string & wind ensembles as they would driving, Afro-pop inspired drum machine rhythms. 

Listen if you like Akron/Family, Sufjan Stevens, the National, Grizzly Bear, Bon Iver.
